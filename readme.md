##About
This repo is a redo of the first project for IS218. 
My first repo is [jll38/IS218_S22_Project_One](https://github.com/jll38/IS218_S22_Project_One).
I misinterpreted the instructions for this assignment,
so rather than cloning the docker_flask repo, I made an
entire project from scratch, the only problem was Heroku would
not work, most likely due that project being held together by
duct-tape. I ended up copying over my content from the original
repo into this, but the layout of the webpages were altered slightly.
If you want to look at the website as how I intended it to look,
feel free to run clone the repo and run it through a docker
container.
